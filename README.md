ACT/SAT Timer Group Project for IB CS SL

Hi Shirley. I figured out how to use GitHub :). This is where you can put your code and experiment with it i.e. making changes etc. Once you have code that is working, you can go to the branch titled "Master" and put it in there. The "Master" branch will be where we have our final copy of the code for submission to Mr. Parker. Good luck coding! - Manisha

public static void main (){
  System.out.println("Hello world!");
}
